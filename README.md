# To Do Application!

This is a personal project. I did it to learn Javascript and [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
#### Steps:

 - Make a HTML template containing a form to add items.
 - Start with the Js file. I thought of adding a doughnut chart at top for better view, so used chart.js to build it.
 - Wrote the functions for adding new item, showing the updated list on the browser, complete task , delete task and more.
 - But on refresh, the items used to disapper, so now included the code for storing array in Local Storage [convert array to String and then store].
